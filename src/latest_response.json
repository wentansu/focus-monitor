The average resting rate of 72.6 BPM is optimal for cardiovascular health, and the variability is normal for short-term measurements.\n\n## Heart Rate Analysis\n\n### Key Statistics\n- **Average:** 72.6 BPM \u2713 Normal range\n- **Range:** 60.0 - 102.0 BPM\n- **Standard Deviation:** 12.1 BPM (moderate variability)\n\n### Health Insights\n\n**Overall Assessment:** Your heart rate appears healthy and within normal parameters.\n\n#### Positive Indicators:\n- **Resting rate of 72.6 BPM** is well within the normal adult range of 60-100 BPM\n- **Baseline stability** - multiple readings at 60, 66, and 72 BPM suggest a stable resting heart rate\n- **Quick readings** collected over 5 seconds shows good data capture efficiency\n\n#### Observations:\n- **Elevated peak (102 BPM)** is slightly above normal resting range but still quite low for active heart rate; could indicate momentary activity or measurement artifact\n- **Moderate variability (SD: 12.1)** is within reasonable bounds for short-term measurements\n- **Multiple low readings** (3 readings at 60 BPM) may indicate good cardiovascular fitness or a very relaxed state\n\n#### Recommendations:\n1. **Compare to your baseline** - If this is typical for you, continue your current lifestyle\n2. **Monitor context** - Note whether these readings were taken at rest, after activity, or during stress\n3. **Check for patterns** - If heart rate spikes like 102 BPM occur consistently, consider tracking triggers\n4. **Resting heart rate** - Multiple readings at 60 BPM could suggest good cardiovascular fitness if you're at rest\n\n### Summary\nThis heart rate data looks healthy with no concerning patterns.
